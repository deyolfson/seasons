##Winter is Coming

###Set the Scene
The snow falls, grey smoke rises, your husband is dead and the good times are no more. You sit in your cabin in 
front of the warm fire waiting for winter to be over. The days are spent sharpening your sword just waiting for 
someone to try you. There is a certain solace in looking out of the window and knowing it's just you in this world
unless it isn't. They are still out there. They are coming.

##UX Interactivity Flow
* The scene is before the user. Beautiful, bold, geometric and cold, so, so cold. 
* The particles are falling in front of the geometric soft and white as snow.
* If the user wants to interact with the piece there will be datGui sliders to change the
1. Amount of snow
2. Speed
3. Amount of wind
* The scene will change to a happy summer scene with groovy music and graphics with the click of a mouse.
